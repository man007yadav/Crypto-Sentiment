* **Num of Messages per day plot** - The number of messages per day are moderate except dates between May 8 and May 11. This event corresponds to Elon Musk joking about dogecoin on Saturday Night Live Show on May 7, 2021, which caused the prices of dogecoin to roughly 30 % of its before price. I could confirm that there were messages where people were discussing about this event in the dataset messages.
